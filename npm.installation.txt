To ensure this website functions correctly, preinstall the following items on your laptop:

1. Web Development Environment
   - Text Editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text) for editing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. Node.js and npm
   - Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are essential for managing JavaScript dependencies and running development servers.
   - Download Node.js: https://nodejs.org/ (npm is included with the installation).

3. Required Packages and Libraries
   - locomotive-scroll: Used for smooth scrolling effects.
     - Install via npm:
       npm install locomotive-scroll
     - Alternatively, include it in the HTML as shown:
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/locomotive-scroll@3.5.4/dist/locomotive-scroll.css">
       <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/locomotive-scroll@3.5.4/dist/locomotive-scroll.js"></script>

4. Web Server
   - You may use Live Server (an extension in Visual Studio Code) or lite-server (can be installed via npm):
     npm install -g lite-server
   - This enables real-time reloading while you make changes to the website files.

5. Fonts and Media
   - Ensure the font files are in the correct directory, as specified in the CSS file (e.g., Neue Haas Grotesk font).
   - Any videos or images referenced in the HTML should also be stored locally or accessible via their URLs.

6. Browser with Developer Tools
   - Use Google Chrome or Firefox for testing, as these browsers have robust developer tools to inspect elements, console logs, and network requests.

By setting up these tools and libraries, you'll have everything you need to edit, test, and run the website smoothly.
